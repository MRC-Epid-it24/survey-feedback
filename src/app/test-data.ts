Vitamin C is important in our&#xfeff; diets for lots of reasons. &#xfeff;It helps us to protect cells, &#xfeff;&#xfeff;keep them healthy and&#xfeff; &#xfeff;helps with wound healing. It also helps us to absorb iron from our diets.&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;<br /><br />Our body cannot make vitamin C and so if we don&#39;t have enough in our diets we might be at risk of getting a disease called scurvy. &#xfeff;<br /><br />Try to include some more vitamin C rich foods in your diet. Some examples include: oranges, orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, potatoes&#xfeff; and red and&#xfeff;&#xfeff; green &#xfeff;peppers.&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;<br /><br />&#xfeff;To find out some &#xfeff;more information about vitamin C&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;&#xfeff;, you can see the NHS website: http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Vitamin-C.aspx&#xfeff;<br /></p>"
